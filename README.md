## History

In 2014, the E-ARK project conducted a survey and published a report on available best practices. The report provided, among other outcomes, an overview of SIP formats used in memory institutions and supported by tools. 

The E-ARK project analysed the formats and then delivered a first version of a harmonised SIP format based on that - Deliverable 3.2 E-ARK SIP Draft Specification. 

That deliverable gave an overview of the structure and main metadata elements for the SIP and provided initial input for the technical implementations of pre-ingest and ingest tools. It was followed by Deliverable 3.3 which extended the previous one by providing a revised version of the D3.2 content, adding more details relevant for tool development and implementation, and describing specific profiles for the transfer of relational databases, electronic records management systems (ERMS) and simple file system based records (SFSB). 

The version 1.4 is based on the deliverable 3.3 and the feedback received from pilot projects.
