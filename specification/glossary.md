| OAIS                                 | The Open Archival Information System is an archive (and a standard: ISO 14721:2003), consisting of an organisation of people and systems that has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a Designated Community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Producing organisation               | The organisational unit or individual that has the authority to transfer records to an archive. Usually the producer is also the records creator but this is not always the case, sometimes the producer is different from the records creator. For example: An author dies and her literary executor gains the authority to transfer her papers to an archive. The author is the records creator and the literary executor is the producer. For example: Department X gets reorganised out of existence and Department Y, which takes over the functional responsibilities of Department X, gains the authority to transfer the records of Department X to the archive. Department X is the records creator and Department Y is the producer. Counter example: The Department of Widget Science transfers some of its own records to the archive. The Department of Widget Science is the records creator and the producer. |
| Submission Information Package (SIP) | An Information Package that is delivered by the Producer to the OAIS for use in the construction or update of one or more AIPs and/or the associated Descriptive Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
