- Requirement 1.3: The Submission Information Package Specification MUST NOT define the scope of data and metadata which constitutes an Information Package. 
- Requirement 1.4: A Submission Information Package SHOULD be highly scalable.
- Requirement 1.5: A Submission Information Package MUST be machine-readable
- Requirement 1.6: A Submission Information Package SHOULD be human-readable
- Requirement 1.7: A Submission Information Package MUST support the preservation method best suited for the data.

### 8.1.2.	Identification of the Information Package 

- Requirement 2.1: The Information Package type (SIP, AIP or DIP) MUST be clearly indicated.
- Requirement 2.2: The Submission Information Package MUST clearly indicate the Content Information Type(s) of its data and metadata.
- Requirement 2.3: A Submission Information Package MUST bear an identifier which is unique and persistent in the scope of the repository.
- Requirement 2.4: A Submission Information Package SHOULD bear an identifier which is globally unique and persistent.
- Requirement 2.5: All components of a Submission Information Package MUST bear an identifier which is unique and persistent within the repository.

### 8.1.3.	Structure of the Information Package 

- Requirement 3.1: A Submission Information Package MUST be built in such a way that its data and metadata can be logically and physically separated from one another.
- Requirement 3.2: The structure of the Submission Information Package SHOULD allow for the separation of different types of metadata
- Requirement 3.3: The structure of the Submission Information Package MUST allow for the separation of data and metadata representations.
- Requirement 3.4: The structure of a Submission Information Package MUST explicitly define the possibilities for adding additional logical components into the Information Package.

| OAIS*                                 | The Open Archival Information System is an archive (and a standard: ISO 14721:2003), consisting of an organisation of people and systems that has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a Designated Community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Producing organisation                | The organizational unit or individual that has the authority to transfer records to an archive. Usually the producer is also the records creator, the organizational unit or individual that created and managed the records during their active use. This is not always the case, sometimes the producer is different from the records creator.For example: An author dies and her literary executor gains the authority to transfer her papers to an archive. The author is the records creator and the literary executor is the producer. For example: Department X gets reorganized out of existence and Department Y, which takes over the functional responsibilities of Department X, gains the authority to transfer the records of Department X to the archive. Department X is the records creator and Department Y is the producer. Counter example: The Department of Widget Science transfers some of its own records to the archive. The Department of Widget Science is the records creator and the producer. |
| Submission Information Package (SIP)* | An Information Package that is delivered by the Producer to the OAIS for use in the construction or update of one or more AIPs and/or the associated Descriptive Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
