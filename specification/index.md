The General SIP Specification was first developed within the E-ARK project in 2014 – 2017. E-ARK was an EC-funded pilot action project in the Competiveness and Innovation Programme 2007- 2013, Grant Agreement no. 620998 under the Policy Support Programme.

The authors of this deliverable would like to thank all national archives, tool developers, the Advisory Board of the E-ARK project and other stakeholders who provided valuable knowledge about their submission information packages and feedback to E-ARK deliverables.

A special gratitude goes to the National Archives of Sweden whose FGS (Förvaltningsgemensam Specifikation) structure influenced the first version of the SIP METS profile development significantly.

The authors would also like to express their gratitude to the team behind the Common Specification for Information Packages document for their enormous effort in agreeing common principles for submission, archival and dissemination packages.
