abstract: |
      This document constitutes a specification on how to produce and parse
      E-ARK Submission Information Packages (SIP). The main objectives of this
      specification are to define the general structure for a Submission
      Information Package format in a way that it is suitable for a wide
      variety of archival scenarios, e.g. document and image collections,
      databases or geographical data, etc.; enhance interoperability between
      Producers and Archives and recommend best practices regarding metadata,
      content and structure of Submission Information Packages. The target
      audience for this specification is records creators, archival
      institutions and software providers that are responsible with preparing,
      packaging, delivering and receiving packages of information to be archived
      in an Open Archival Information System Reference Model (OAIS), i.e.
      pre-ingest and ingest functional units.
