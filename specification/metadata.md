title: E-ARK SIP
subtitle: Specification for Submission Information Packages
abstract: |
  This document provides a comprehensive specification for the creation and parsing 
  of E-ARK Submission Information Packages (SIP). Its primary goals include outlining
  a general-purpose structure for Submission Information Packages that accommodates 
  a diverse array of archival materialsâ€”such as document and image collections, databases, 
  and geographical data. Additionally, it aims to improve interoperability between 
  Producers and Archives by recommending best practices for metadata, content, and
  the structural organization of Submission Information Packages. This specification is
  designed for a broad audience, including record creators, archival institutions, and 
  software providers tasked with the preparation, packaging, delivery, and reception of 
  information packages for archiving within an Open Archival Information System (OAIS), 
  specifically targeting the pre-ingest and ingest stages.
