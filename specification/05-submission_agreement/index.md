# 5.	SUBMISSION AGREEMENT 

Interaction between the Archive and Producers is often formalized and guided by a Submission Agreement, which establishes specific details of the interaction such as the type of information submitted, the metadata the Producer is expected to provide, the logistics of the actual transfer of custody from the Producer to the archive, and any access restrictions attached to the submitted material. (avoie B, The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model: Introductory Guide (2nd Edition), 2014, www.dpconline.org/component/docman/doc_download/1359-dpctw14-02) According to the OAIS model the submission agreement is an agreement reached between an Archive and the Producer that specifies a data model, and any other arrangements needed, for the Data Submission Session. This data model identifies format/contents and the logical constructs used by the Producer and how they are represented on each media delivery or in a telecommunication session. (Reference Model for an Open Archival Information, 2012, public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0m2.pdf)
 
The E-ARK project acknowledged the importance of submission agreements and provided a way for referencing it in a METS.xml regardless of its form. (A submission agreement can be delivered in a digital (e.g. PDF or XML file) or an analogue way (e.g. paper document).) This document does describe a recommended format for a Submission Agreement (Appendix B: Submission Agreement), but of course does not forbid the use of any other Submission Agreement format.

According to the [PAIMAS, 2004](http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/651x0m1.pdf) standard the submission agreement should include a complete and precise definition of:
 
- information to be transferred (e.g., SIP contents, SIP packaging, data models, Designated Community, legal and contractual aspects);
- transfer definition (e.g. specification of the Data Submission Sessions);
- validation definition;
- change management (e.g. conditions for modification of the agreement, for breaking the agreement);
- schedule (submission timetable).


The submission agreement is inspired by the PAIMAS requirements and the submission agreement template provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This document will propose a list of elements which are recommended to be recorded in the submission agreement (8.2).
