        E-ARK Submission Information Packages (SIP). The main objectives of this

        variety of archival scenarios, e.g. document and image collections,
        databases or geographical data, etc.; enhance interoperability between
        Producers and Archives and recommend best practices regarding metadata,
        content and structure of Submission Information Packages.
        The target audience for this specification is records creators, archival
        institutions and software providers that are responsible with preparing,
        packaging, delivering and receiving packages of information to be archived
        in an Open Archival Information System Reference Model (OAIS),
        i.e. pre-ingest and ingest functional units.
